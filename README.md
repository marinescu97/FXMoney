# FXMoney - JavaFX Bank Application

Welcome to FXMoney, a JavaFX bank application that I developed to showcase my Java programming skills and knowledge of JavaFx for developing GUIs.

FXMoney is a simulation of a bank that allows users to log in through three possible roles: Admin, Banker, and Client.

## Description
FXMoney has designed a wide range of features depending on the roles that might be useful for the platform's usage:

### Admin

-   **User Management**: Adding, updating, and deleting users, i.e. bankers and clients.
-   **User Information**: Seeing details related to the user.
-   **Statistics**: Access statistics about users, accounts, transactions, and loans.

-   **Requesting a Loan for a Client**: Bankers are able to help clients in obtaining loans by going to the 'Request Loan' section. In this area, you will input the client's loan information and send the request for approval. This functionality showcases the important role that bankers play in providing financial services tailored to clients' requirements.
